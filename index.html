  <p> “Circle gets the square” is a short movie on a very straightforward topic - circles. The spaces of the Arts Center at NYUAD are filled with different shapes, but it does not come to our mind to check their actual repetitiveness. A circle is regarded as a symbol of unity and perfection - the visual harmony of the Arts Center is supported by it. </p>
  <p> This movie captures an unexpected occurrence of the ultimate geometric form in the interior space, and as the saying goes, the circle gets the square - the idea is not complex, but it provokes the viewer to look around and pay attention to little things.</p>
